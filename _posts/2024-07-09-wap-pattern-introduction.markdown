# Introduction to the Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) Pattern

## What is the WAP Pattern?

The Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) pattern is a robust approach to building reliable data pipelines that separates the process of writing data, validating its quality, and making it available for consumption. This pattern leverages modern data lakehouse technologies to provide isolation between these phases, ensuring that only high-quality, validated data is published for downstream consumers.

The WAP pattern consists of three distinct phases:

1. **Write Phase**: Data is written to a staging or temporary location, isolated from production data.
2. **Audit Phase**: Data quality checks and validation rules are applied to ensure the data meets required standards.
3. **Publish Phase**: Once validated, data is made available to consumers through an atomic operation.

## Why Use the WAP Pattern?

Traditional data pipelines often suffer from several challenges:

- **Data Quality Issues**: Problems are discovered after data is already in production
- **Downtime During Updates**: Consumers experience disruptions during data updates
- **Lack of Isolation**: Writing and reading operations interfere with each other
- **Difficult Rollbacks**: Reverting problematic data changes is complex and error-prone
- **Limited Testing**: Insufficient validation before data reaches consumers

The WAP pattern addresses these challenges by:

- **Ensuring Data Quality**: Comprehensive validation before data is published
- **Providing Isolation**: Writing and publishing are separate operations
- **Enabling Atomic Updates**: Consumers see consistent data views
- **Supporting Easy Rollbacks**: Problematic changes can be reverted without complex procedures
- **Facilitating Testing**: Data can be thoroughly tested before being published

## Core Components of the WAP Pattern

### 1. Branch-Based Development

The WAP pattern leverages branch-based development for data, similar to how software engineers use Git branches:

- **Feature Branches**: Data transformations are developed in isolation
- **Development Branch**: Integration testing occurs here
- **Main Branch**: Production data that consumers access

### 2. Atomic Operations

Atomic operations ensure that data consumers always see a consistent view:

- **Transactions**: All changes are committed as a single unit
- **No Partial Updates**: Consumers never see partially updated data
- **Consistent Views**: All consumers see the same version of data

### 3. Data Quality Gates

Data quality gates prevent problematic data from reaching production:

- **Schema Validation**: Ensuring data structure is correct
- **Business Rules**: Applying domain-specific validation rules
- **Statistical Checks**: Detecting anomalies and outliers
- **Referential Integrity**: Verifying relationships between datasets

## Technologies Enabling the WAP Pattern

Modern data lakehouse technologies make the WAP pattern possible:

- **Apache Iceberg**: Provides ACID transactions and schema evolution
- **Project Nessie**: Enables Git-like versioning and branching for data
- **Apache Spark**: Powers distributed data processing
- **MinIO**: Offers S3-compatible object storage
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates the entire pipeline

## Real-World Use Cases

The WAP pattern is particularly valuable in scenarios such as:

1. **Financial Reporting**: Ensuring accuracy and consistency in financial data
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting strict data quality requirements
3. **Customer-Facing Analytics**: Providing reliable data for customer dashboards
4. **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Ensuring high-quality training data
5. **Multi-Tenant Data Platforms**: Isolating tenant data processing

## Benefits of the WAP Pattern

### For Data Engineers

- **Improved Development Workflow**: Isolated development and testing
- **Reduced Production Issues**: Problems caught before reaching production
- **Better Collaboration**: Multiple engineers can work on different branches
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Clear separation of pipeline stages

### For Data Consumers

- **Higher Data Quality**: Only validated data is published
- **Consistent Views**: No partial or inconsistent updates
- **Improved Reliability**: Fewer disruptions and data quality issues
- **Better Documentation**: Clear lineage and quality metrics

### For Organizations

- **Reduced Risk**: Lower chance of data-related incidents
- **Increased Trust**: Higher confidence in data quality
- **Improved Compliance**: Better controls for regulatory requirements
- **Enhanced Agility**: Faster, safer data pipeline development

## When to Use the WAP Pattern

The WAP pattern is most beneficial when:

- Data quality is critical to business operations
- Multiple teams consume the same datasets
- Regulatory compliance requires strict data controls
- Data pipelines are complex and involve multiple stages
- Rollback capabilities are essential

However, the pattern may introduce additional complexity for very simple use cases or when immediate data availability is more important than quality validation.

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll explore how to implement the WAP pattern using a modern data stack:

1. First, we'll review the technology stack in detail
2. Then, we'll set up our local environment with Docker Compose
3. Finally, we'll implement each phase of the pattern with practical examples

Let's begin by diving into the technology stack that powers our implementation.
